# M5IsobusVT

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-EUPL1.2-green)](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/eupl-text-eupl-12)

This is an implementation of an ISOBUS-VT on the M5-Stack module. Most of the code is from my College Reinhard HÃ¼bner (thank you very much for this great work). I only rearange some part of the code to compile it with PlatformIO and remove some unused code.

the project contains in the 'lib'-directory all references to used libs. There is no need to add external libs. 
## Remark
Don't add M5Stack as external lib, because there are some changes to the original lib.

### PlatformIO and Arduino-IDE
Projekt was build and testet with PlatformIO, for Arduino-IDE we will add in future some extra infos.

...still a first apha-version...there will be more documentation in near future ;-)
